    "This notebook was written to allow users to explore how collision volume varies around the location of new building sites in the periods before, during and after construction. There are six different use cases that allow users to explore how various factors affect collision volume. In each use case the user may choose from a drop down menu that will change the information that is plotted on the maps. Each use case plots three maps. The maps show the city of Seattle and each  marker on the map represents a building.  The below legend shows how to interpret the size and color of the markers. Users may also click on the marker to see how many collisions occured. \n",
